    "Multicollinearity happens when predictor variables exhibit a correlation among themselves. Ridge regression aims at reducing the standard error by adding some bias in the estimates of the regression. The reduction of the standard error in regression estimates significantly increases the reliability of the estimates."

    "The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge"
